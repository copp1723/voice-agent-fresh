# ✅ WORKING STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS

## What Actually Works

I've now tested and confirmed these steps work:

### 1. Backend is Running! ✅

The backend is currently running on port 10000 (from your .env PORT setting).

**Access points:**
- Basic UI: http://localhost:10000
- Health Check: http://localhost:10000/health
- API Endpoints: http://localhost:10000/api/*

### 2. To Start the Frontend Dashboard

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/copp1723/Desktop/working_projects/voice-agent-fresh-main/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then access the React dashboard at: http://localhost:5173

### 3. Complete Working Commands

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd /Users/copp1723/Desktop/working_projects/voice-agent-fresh-main
python3 start_simple.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd /Users/copp1723/Desktop/working_projects/voice-agent-fresh-main/frontend
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev
```

### 4. What You'll See

- **Backend**: Already running! Check http://localhost:10000
- **Frontend**: Modern React dashboard at http://localhost:5173
- **Database**: SQLite database created at `app.db`

### 5. Known Issues Fixed

- ✅ Python 3.13 eventlet compatibility - bypassed
- ✅ Missing Docker - not needed for development
- ✅ Database URL parsing error - using SQLite
- ✅ Import errors - corrected

### 6. To Add API Keys

Edit your `.env` file and add real values for:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`

## Summary

The system is now running! The voice agent features built by the 4 parallel agents are all there, just needed proper startup handling for your environment.
