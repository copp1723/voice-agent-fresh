# Chatterbox TTS Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Completed

### 1. **Chatterbox Service Created** (`src/services/chatterbox_service.py`)
- Emotion-aware TTS with 5 presets: neutral, empathetic, excited, calm, apologetic
- Automatic emotion detection based on text content
- Voice cloning support for each agent type
- Twilio audio optimization (8kHz Œº-law encoding)
- Fallback handling when model fails to load

### 2. **Enhanced Voice Processor** (`src/services/enhanced_voice_processor.py`)
- Seamless integration of Chatterbox with OpenAI fallback
- Conversation sentiment analysis for dynamic emotion
- Maintains full compatibility with existing Twilio integration
- Agent-specific voice and emotion mappings

### 3. **Migration Completed**
- Updated imports in existing codebase
- Created voice samples directory structure
- Added Chatterbox configuration to .env
- Installed all dependencies including PyTorch

### 4. **Configuration Added to .env**
```env
# Chatterbox TTS Settings
USE_CHATTERBOX=true
OPTIMIZE_FOR_TWILIO=true

# Voice Sample Paths (optional - for voice cloning)
GENERAL_VOICE_SAMPLE=voice_samples/general_voice_sample.wav
BILLING_VOICE_SAMPLE=voice_samples/billing_voice_sample.wav
SUPPORT_VOICE_SAMPLE=voice_samples/support_voice_sample.wav
SALES_VOICE_SAMPLE=voice_samples/sales_voice_sample.wav
SCHEDULING_VOICE_SAMPLE=voice_samples/scheduling_voice_sample.wav
```

## üîß Integration Architecture

### Emotion Detection Flow:
1. Text analysis for keywords (sorry ‚Üí apologetic, great news ‚Üí excited)
2. Conversation sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
3. Agent-specific emotion tendencies (billing ‚Üí empathetic, sales ‚Üí excited)
4. Dynamic emotion parameters passed to Chatterbox

### Voice Generation Flow:
```
Text ‚Üí Emotion Detection ‚Üí Chatterbox TTS ‚Üí Audio Optimization ‚Üí Twilio
                              ‚Üì (fallback)
                          OpenAI TTS
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

The Chatterbox model appears to have loading issues on macOS ARM64 (M1/M2). This is likely due to:
1. Model download timing out on first run
2. Potential compatibility issues with Apple Silicon
3. The warning about deprecated pkg_resources

## üìã Next Steps to Complete Integration

1. **Fix Model Loading**:
   ```bash
   # Try loading model separately
   python3 -c "from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS; model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device='cpu')"
   ```

2. **Add API Keys to .env**:
   - Set your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Configure Twilio credentials

3. **Test with OpenAI Fallback**:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily disable Chatterbox to test OpenAI
   USE_CHATTERBOX=false python3 test_chatterbox_integration.py
   ```

4. **Create Voice Samples** (optional):
   - Record 10-30 seconds of speech for each agent
   - Save as WAV files in `voice_samples/` directory

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

1. **Emotion-Aware Speech**:
   - Automatically adjusts voice emotion based on context
   - Different emotions for apologies, excitement, empathy

2. **Agent Personalities**:
   - Billing: Empathetic and understanding
   - Sales: Excited and enthusiastic
   - Support: Calm and reassuring
   - Scheduling: Neutral and professional

3. **Seamless Fallback**:
   - If Chatterbox fails, automatically uses OpenAI TTS
   - No disruption to existing functionality

4. **Twilio Optimization**:
   - Audio automatically converted to Twilio-preferred format
   - Maintains compatibility with existing phone system

## üöÄ Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Consider using CPU-only PyTorch for better compatibility:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

2. Pre-download the Chatterbox model to avoid timeouts:
   ```python
   from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
   model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device='cpu')
   # Save model for faster loading
   ```

3. Monitor logs for emotion detection patterns to refine the system

The integration is architecturally complete and will provide emotion-aware, agent-specific voice synthesis once the model loading issue is resolved.
