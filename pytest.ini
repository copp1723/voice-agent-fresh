[pytest]
; This is the pytest configuration file.
; It can be used to set default options and behaviors for pytest.

python_files = test_*.py tests_*.py *_test.py *_tests.py
; The above line tells pytest to discover tests in files that match these patterns.

; Add markers here if needed, e.g.:
; markers =
; slow: marks tests as slow to run
; integration: marks integration tests
